        <ul>
            <li>
                The HTML Canvas API is used to draw images through JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                Canvas can improve the performance of websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network.
            </li>
            <li>
                Canvas was first developed by Apple, so it is similar to Quarts 2D.
            </li>
            <li>
                The canvas element is put straight into the HTML, with the size declared in HTML instead of CSS.
            </li>
            <li>
                The canvas is selected and manipulated through JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                You set the strokeStyle and fillStyle attributes with the desired colors prior to actually drawing the
                image.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can draw rectangles with fillRect() and strokeRect()
            </li>
            <li>
                Shapes can be filled with patterns instead of solid colors, such as images or gradients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Other shapes can be drawn by creating paths. Paths create a blueprint for your lines, arcs, and shapes.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can save canvas drawings to a URL, which can allow them to be saved locally.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can draw specific images to a canvas as well using drawImage()
            </li>
            <li>
                Images in the canvas can be manipulated to do things such as alter the color style to black and white,
                or some other style.
            </li>
            <li>
                Similarly, videos can be color-changed with canvas manipulation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Canvas can also allow text to be displayed, such as for error handling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Canvas doesn’t create a DOM node, so it is essentially invisible to tools like screen readers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are images that preserve their quality even as they blow up or shrink
                down.
            </li>
            <li>
                SVG can do many of the same things as canvas including drawing paths, shapes, text, gradients, and
                patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drawing a circle in SVG is much easier than in canvas. It uses the 'circle' tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drawing a rectangle is done using the 'rect' tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                Canvas allows for pixel manipulation but operates in immediate mode. Meaning, once a shape is created it
                cannot be accessed, it would need to be redrawn.
            </li>
            <li>
                Canvas can allow the image to be saves as a PNG or JPEG file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Canvas is faster than SVG.
            </li>
            <li>
                SVG operates in retained mode, meaning that the structure of the image is preserved in the XML document.
            </li>
            <li>
                SVG has a more complete set of tools, but SVG cannot manipulate pixels as canvas does.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drag and Drop is an API that allows certain elements to be draggable and then to specify what happens
                when they are dropped onto other elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drag and Drop is not supported by Android or IOS, therefore it is not useful for mobile applications.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drag and Drop can be combined with the File API to allow files to be dragged from a desktop onto the
                website.
            </li>
            <li>
                The draggable attribute is added to an element. Because it isn’t a Boolean attribute it must be
                explicitly set to true.
            </li>
            <li>
                A dragstart event listener should be added to the draggable items.
            </li>
            <li>
                both dragover and drop event listeners can be added to the elements that the draggable items would be
                dropped on.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drag and drop would be great for a card game application.
            </li>
