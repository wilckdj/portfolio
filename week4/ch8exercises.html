    <ul>
        <li>
            Forms generally submit information to be processed on the back end, but can be also processed on the front
            end.
        </li>
        <li>
            Forms can be selected with JavaScript using form = document.forms[#],
            document.getElementsByTagname('form')[#], or document.forms.name.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The ideal method is: document.forms['name'];
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The form elements can can be access/assigned through form.elements or form.name / form['name']
        </li>
        <li>
            form.submit() will submit the form automatically.
        </li>
        <li>
            forms can also be submitted manually by a button or input element with the submit type.
        </li>
        <li>
            form.reset() will reset all the form controls back to initial values.
        </li>
        <li>
            A button with a type of 'reset' will also reset the form.
        </li>
        <li>
            form.action can be used to set the action attribut of a form so its sent to another URL for server
            processing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Focus events occur when an element of a form is focused on.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blur events occur when focus moves away from a form element.
        </li>
        <li>
            Change events occur when the element is changed and the focus leaves the element.
        </li>
        <li>
            Submit events occure when the form is submitted, usually to send the content to the server.
        </li>
        <li>
            Javascript can intercept the form before it is sent using a submit event listener.
        </li>
        <li>
            preventDefault() can stop the submission from being sent.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can establish a default value for the input using input.value = "";
        </li>
        <li>
            You can use focus and blur event listeners to clear and add a default value such as "Search Here".
        </li>
        <li>
            An alternative is to use the placeholder attribute, but it doesn't act as a value for submission.
        </li>
        <li>
