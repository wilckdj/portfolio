        <ul>
            <li>
                Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is often used to model representations of objects in the real world.
            </li>
            <li>
                OOP has three main concepts: encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.
            </li>
            <li>
                Encapsulation: The inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and the essential functions are
                exposed
                to the end user.
            </li>
            <li>
                Polymorphism: The same process can be used for different objects, or various objects can share methods.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inheritance: Taking the features of one object then adding some new features.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unlike Java and Ruby that are class-based languages, JavaScript is a prototype-based language.
            </li>
            <li>
                Constructor Functions can be used when creating objects to define the properties and methods of an
                object.
            </li>
            <li>
                With contructor functions, you can creat new instances using the 'new' operator.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can create constructor functions or use the built-in constructor functions.
            </li>
            <li>
                JavaScript ES6 introduces the class declaration which does the same thing as a constuctor function, but
                is
                similar to writing a class in other programming languages.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is good practice to capitalize constructor function names.
            </li>
            <li>
                ES6 class declarations are preferable to the constructor function because they are easier to read and is
                implicitly in strict mode.
            </li>
            <li>
                All objects have a constructor property that returns the constructor function that created it.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you don't know the name of an objects constructor, you can use the constructor property to
                instantiate a
                copy.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        ex: const greenDice = new redDice.constructor(10);
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The static keyword can be used to create a static method, which can only be called from the class
                directly
                and not from instances.
            </li>
            <li>
                Javascript uses prototypal inheritance, every class has a prototype property shared by every instance.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want to add things to the class affter it is created, you can use the prototype property of the
                class.
            </li>
            <li>
                Properties that are inherited from the prototype porperty are not the object's own property.
            </li>
            <li>
                The prototype object is live, so other instances of a class inherit new properties and methods
                automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can overwrite properties and methods inherited from an object's prototype by assigning a new value
                to
                them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prototype should be used to define any properties that will remain the same for every instance of the
                class.
            </li>
            <li>
                Object methods in JavaScript are public by default, meaning they can be queried and changed by
                assignment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using variable scope, some properties and methods can be kept private inside of a class declaration.
            </li>
            <li>
                Because a prototype is just another object, it has its own prototype, which has a prototype, causing a
                chain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enumerable properties are properties that show up when a for-in loop is used.
            </li>
            <li>
                A class can inherit from another class using the extends keyword in a class declaration.
            </li>
            <li>
                Polymorphism means that different objects can have the same method used in different ways.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adding methods to built-in objects is known as monkey-patching, and is mostly frowned upon.
            </li>
            <li>
                An alternative to monkey-patching is using the extends keyword to build a subclass for your own methods.
            </li>
