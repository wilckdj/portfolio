    <h2>Week 2 Notes</h2>
    <H3>Chapter 4</H3>
    <p>Function examples are available in the console.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Functions can be defined in at least three ways
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Function declaration: function hello() {}
                </li>
                <li>
                    Function expression: const goodbye = function(){}; const goodbye = function bye(){}
                </li>
                <li>
                    Arrow functions: const square = x => x*x
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Every function has a name, for anonymous functions the name is empty or undefined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Functions can be declared with the constructor Function(): const hi = new Function('...'); but it isn't the
            best method.
        </li>
        <li>
            Functions are invoked (called) by typing its name followed by parenthesis: hello()
        </li>
        <li>
            DRY means "Don't Repeat Yourself", meaning code should not be duplicated but instead only written once.
        </li>
        <li>
            For a function to return a value, you must include the return keyword and the value being returned in the
            function: return "Hello World.";
        </li>
        <li>
            Parameters are the specified values that a function uses, arguments are the values provided for the
            parameters.
        </li>
        <li>
            There will probably be rounding errors with these functions, but it shouldn't cause too much of a problem.
        </li>
        <li>
            Functions can have a variable number of arguments.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each function has an arguments variable, it isn't an array but it has a length property.
                </li>
                <li>
                    the better option is to use the rest operator: '...'. Place the three dots before the last parameter
                    in the declaration.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Default parameters can be specified: function hello(name = 'World'){}
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrow functions: Parameters come before the arrow, body comes after. They are always anonymous so must be
            assigned to a variable if you want to refer to them.
        </li>
        <li>
            If arrow function has no parameters, empty parenthesis must come before the arrow: const hello = () =>
            alert('Hello World');
        </li>
        <li>
            Longer arrow functions require curly braces and the return keyword
        </li>
        <li>
            Hoisting is when the javascript interpreter moves function and variable <u>declarations</u> to the top of
            the current scope.
        </li>
        <li>
            Function Hoisting is where the function can be called at the top, and the declaration can be at the bottom,
            but it still works okay.
        </li>
        <li>
            Variable Hoisting only works with the var keyword, so if you are going to use let or const it must be
            declared at the top of the scope.
        </li>
        <li>
            Callbacks are when a function is passed as an argument to another function.
        </li>
        <li>
            Javascript can't define a parameter as a callback, so you can use an if statement to only run the function
            if a function name is provided: if(typeof(callback) === 'function'){...}
        </li>
        <li>
            You can use a callback to improve the functionality of the sort() method for arrays.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrow Iterators: Arrow functions can use callbacks with their methods.
        </li>
        <li>
            forEach(): like a for loop, but goes through each item in an array and can invoke a callback function. 
        </li>
        <li>
            map(): similary to forEach(), but returns a new array with the results. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce(): also goes through each value of an array, but cumulatively combines them to return a single value. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Filter(): acts like a filter, goes through an array of values and returns the values that return true when passed through a callback.
        </li>
        <li>
            Because some of these iterator methods return an array, other iterators can be chained on to it to perform their action on the resulting array. 
        </li>
    </ul>
