                I had struggled to understand the benefit/usage of node.js when we first learned about it in Week 9.
            </li>
            <li>
                This week 11 assignment using the local server really helped me to understand node.js better.
            </li>
            <li>
                I was the driver for the team activity this week, but I felt very confused as my group was working on
                the assignment.
            </li>
            <li>
                We were able to get through a good portion of the assignment, but left the rest of the assignment to be
                completed individually.
            </li>
            <li>
                By working through the assignment and going line-by-line through the instructor's example, I felt like I
                was more fully able to uderstand how to use error handling and error objects.
            </li>
            <li>
                I also figured out that my version of the program wasn't working because I had my login button as a
                'submit' type, instead of a standard 'button'. This caused it to not fully process the functions for
                displaying the posts. I was able to figure out this error by looking through the instructor solution
                line-by-line.
