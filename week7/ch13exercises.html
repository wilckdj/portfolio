            <li>
                Ajax allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server and dynamically update webpages
                without reloading.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clients request resources from a server, servers send responses back to client.
            </li>
            <li>
                Javascript is a client-side language, Ajax allows it to request resources from a server.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ajax can be practice with a local development server or a website that uses Cross-origin resource
                sharing (CORS)
            </li>
            <li>
                Asynchronous means that the program doesn't have to stop and wait for the response.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ajax originally sent back XML documents, but JSON is most commonly used now.
            </li>
            <li>
                Application programming interfaces (API) are methods that allow external access to a program or service.
            </li>
            <li>
                The fetch API is the standard for requesting and sending data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fetch uses promises to avoid callback issues.
            </li>
            <li>
                fetch() has only one mandatory argument, the URL being fetched.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fetch uses promises, so the catch statement can deal with errors.
            </li>
            <li>
                The response interface for fetch has an ‘ok’ property that is true if the response was
                successful/created.
            </li>
            <li>
                The redirect() method can be used to redirect to another URL.
            </li>
            <li>
                text() method takes a stream of text and returns a promise.
            </li>
            <li>
                blob() reads a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet. The promise resolves with a blob
                object.
            </li>
            <li>
                JSON is the most common format for AJAX responses. json() transforms a stream of JSON into a promise.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can create your own response object using a constructor: const response = new Response(“”,{});
            </li>
            <li>
                By providing a Request object you get more control over the request being made.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are five commonly used HTTP verbs (methods): GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
            </li>
            <li>
                HTTP headers pass on additional information about a request or response.
            </li>
            <li>
                AJAX can also be used to send information to a server.
            </li>
            <li>
                AJAX is a living standard, meaning it is developed in the wild. It can and will change as feedback is
                provided about how it works.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you don’t want to deal with the “wild”, libraries like jQuery can handle your AJAX requests.
            </li>
