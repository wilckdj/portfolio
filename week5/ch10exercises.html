        <p>Some examples are in the console and code comments. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                There are three types of errors:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        System Error: Problem with the system or external devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Programmer error: Program contains incorrect syntax or logic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User error: User entered data incorrectly
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Programmers are responsible for minimizing and fixing programmer errors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Programmers should be aware of potential system and user errors to prevent them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Exceptions are errors that produce a return value that can be used to deal with the error. (ex:
                ReferenceError)
            </li>
            <li>
                Exceptions produce a stack trace, or the sequence of functions that lead to the error.
            </li>
            <li>
                Warnings occur when there is an error that doesn't stop the program from running. (ex: assigning to
                undeclared variable)
            </li>
            <li>
                Javascript is fairly forgiving when it comes to errors, and will sometimes fail silently.
            </li>
            <li>
                Because Javascript fails silently, programmers should make code that failes loudly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Strict mode allows JavaScript to produce more exceptions and warnings, and prohibits use of deprecated
                features.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Strict mode is used by adding the following as the first line of the js file: 'use strict';
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Sloppy mode is a term for when strict mode is not used.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can apply strict mode to a function by adding 'use strict'; to the start of the function.
            </li>
            <li>
                Modules do not need 'use strict' because they are in strict mode by default.
            </li>
            <li>
                Linting Tools (JS Lint, JS Hint, ES Lint) highlight sloppy programming practices and syntax errors. They
                can also enforce a programming style guide.
            </li>
            <li>
                Feature Detection is using an if statement to check whether a feature of a browser exists before
                trying to call a method.
            </li>
            <li>
                Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code.
            </li>
            <li>
                Putting alert() in the code is a basic form of debugging because alerts stop the program from running.
            </li>
            <li>
                Code can be debugged in the console, using console.log(), console.trace(), and other methods.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can also use the console debugging tool to create breakpoints for pausing the code and playing
                through it.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'debugger' keyword to create a breakpoint in the code to pause it.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The 'debugger' keyword should always be removed before the code is shipped.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Error objects can be created by the host environement or in the code using a constructor function.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Other Error objects are: RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, URIError,
                        InternalError
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Safe error object properties across browsers are: name, message, stack.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                You can throw your own exceptions using the 'throw' statement. It is best to throw an error object.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'throw' statement can be included in an if statement.
            </li>
            <li>
                When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. This is ideal in development,
                but not in production.
            </li>
            <li>
                Errors can be hidden from users but still identified.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you think a code will throw an exception, you can wrap it in a try block: try {} catch(error) {}
                finally {}
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Resulting errors will be thrown into a catch block.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If no error, the program will run.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        finally blocks are optional, but will always execute after the try or catch block, regardless of
                        an exception.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Testing the code is important, you can write tests to ensure that the code works properly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Test-driven development (TDD) means writing the tests first, then writing the code to pass the tests. 
            </li>
            <li>
                There are programs to help with test driven development. Not everyone uses TDD though. 
            </li>
        </ul>
