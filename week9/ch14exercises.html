        <ul>
            <li>
                HTML5 is the latest version of HTML for creating webpages.
            </li>
            <li>
                Many APIs were made available in HTML5 and beyond.
            </li>
            <li>
                The HTML5 specification is separated into modules that allow different features to be implemented
                without having to wait for others to be completed.
            </li>
            <li>
                The ‘data-‘ attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored
                by the browser. They are private to a page.
            </li>
            <li>
                They must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.
            </li>
            <li>
                each element has a dataset property that can be sued to access any ‘data-‘ attribute it contains.
            </li>
            <li>
                ’data-powers’ is accessed by ‘.dataset.powers’. ‘data-max-length’ is accessed by ‘dataset.maxLength’.
            </li>
            <li>
                you could also still use .getAttribute(‘data-powers’);
            </li>
            <li>
                APIs help developers access and control new features that appear in the latest devices. It is best
                practice to use feature detection before using any of the API methods.
            </li>
            <li>
                Web Storage API (localStorage) is similar to cookies but has differences.
            </li>
            <li>
                Web Storage does not have an actual data limit, but most browsers limit it at 5GB per domain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stored data does not automatically expire as with cookies.
            </li>
            <li>
                If web storage is supported, window will have localStorage and sessionStorage. Local Storage is more
                permenant, sessionStorage is only for the current session.
            </li>
            <li>
                localStorage can trigger event listeners through the ‘storage’ event that can report the .key,
                .oldValue. newValue, and .storageArea.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. It can find the user’s
                exact location then link to nearby places.
            </li>
            <li>
                navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(); can return your position object.
            </li>
            <li>
                The position object has several properties:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        position.coords.latitude (.longitude)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        position.speed - ground speed of the device, meters per second.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        position.altitude - estimate of the devices altitude in meters above the WGS84 ellipsoid.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        position.heading – the direction the device is moving in. In degrees, clockwise from North.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        position.timestamp – the time the position was recorded.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        position.accuracy (position.altitudeAccuracy) – how accurate the returned values are.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                navigator.geolocation.watchposition() will call a function every time the position of the device is
                updated.
            </li>
            <li>
                navigator.geolocation.clearWatch() stops the callback from being called.
            </li>
            <li>
                Web workers allow processes to be run in the background adding support for concurrency in JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                Workers are created using the Worker() constructor function.
            </li>
            <li>
                Workers use the concept of messages to communicate back and forth between the main script and the worker
                script.
            </li>
            <li>
                Messages are posed with worker.postMessage(“hello”); they can be listened for with event listeners for
                “message” events.
            </li>
            <li>
                Workers can be terminated after the tasks are completed, using .terminate() from the main script or
                self.close() from the worker script.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shared Web Workers allow lots of different scripts on the same domain to access the same worker object.
            </li>
            <li>
                Service Workers API allows a worker script to run in the background with the added benefit of being able
                to intercept network requests.
            </li>
            <li>
                Websocket is a protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – push messaging.
            </li>
            <li>
                Websocket uses event listeners and responses from a server to work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Notification API allows you to show messages using the system’s notifications. Such as a popup in the
                corner of the screen.
            </li>
            <li>
                Before notifications can be sent, permission must be granted by the user.
                Notification.requestPermission() returns a promis with the permission property set either to granted or
                denied.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multimedia (audio and video) is also available through HTML5.
            </li>
            <li>
                The ‘audio’ and ‘video’ tags insert audio and video clips into a web page. The text between the tags
                will only display if the browser does not support them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Both the audio and video elements have many properties and methods to control the playback, change
                volume, and otherwise affect the media.
            </li>
